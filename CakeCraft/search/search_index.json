Try adding an extra tablespoon of buttermilk or milk. Use Oil Instead of Butter : Oil tends to keep cakes moist for longer since it doesn\u2019t solidify when cooled, unlike butter. Stick to oil for a soft, tender crumb. You can even increase the oil by half a tablespoon for more moisture. Don\u2019t Overbake : Make sure to monitor the baking time closely. Even a few extra minutes can dry out a cake. Start checking at the 15-minute mark (instead of 18) to avoid overbaking. Add Yogurt for Extra Moisture : If the buttermilk isn\u2019t enough, you can add 1 tablespoon of thick yogurt to the wet ingredients to boost moisture. Simple Syrup : This is a bakery secret. Brush the cake with simple syrup (equal parts sugar and water, boiled and cooled) once it\u2019s out of the oven. This prevents drying out and adds extra softness. Consider Adding Fatty Ingredients : For a more tender, soft crumb, you can add 1 tablespoon of mayonnaise or sour cream. This boosts the moisture without making the cake soggy. Updated Recipe : Ingredients : All-purpose flour : \u00bd cup (60 grams) Cornstarch : 1 tablespoon (for softness) Baking powder : \u00bd teaspoon Baking soda : \u215b teaspoon Jaggery powder (or sugar) : \u00bc cup (50 grams) Oil : 2\u00bd tablespoons (increase for more moisture) Buttermilk from curd : \u00bc cup + 2 tablespoons (increase by 1 tablespoon) To make buttermilk: 2 tablespoons curd (yogurt) mixed with water or milk. Vanilla extract : \u00bd teaspoon Vinegar or lemon juice : \u00bc teaspoon Pinch of salt : Optional Simple syrup : For brushing after baking. Instructions : Mix Dry Ingredients : Sift flour, cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together. Mix Wet Ingredients : Whisk oil, jaggery powder, buttermilk, vanilla extract, vinegar, and an optional tablespoon of yogurt. Combine Wet & Dry Ingredients : Gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet mixture. Bake : In the air fryer at 150\u00b0C (300\u00b0F) for 15-20 minutes , checking at the 15-minute mark. Brush with Simple Syrup : As soon as the cake is out of the oven, brush it lightly with simple syrup to lock in moisture. These tweaks should give your cake a much softer, bakery-like texture.","title":"Vanilla Cake V1.1"},{"location":"cake/vanilla_cake_v1.1/#vanilla-cake-v11","text":"To make your vanilla cake soft like a bakery cake (without being too moist or dry), you can make a few important adjustments:","title":"Vanilla Cake V1.1"},{"location":"cake/vanilla_cake_v1.1/#key-adjustments","text":"Increase Liquid Content Slightly : Add a bit more buttermilk (or milk) to ensure the cake has enough moisture without becoming too wet.

Stick to oil for a soft, tender crumb. You can even increase the oil by half a tablespoon for more moisture. Don\u2019t Overbake : Make sure to monitor the baking time closely.

So, that some moisture remains inside keeping the bread enough moist. Tips 2 To make your cake softer and more like the fluffy texture you find in bakery cakes, you can try the following modifications: 1. Use Cake Flour Instead of All-Purpose Flour Cake flour has lower protein content than all-purpose flour, which results in a softer and more tender crumb. - If you don\u2019t have cake flour, you can make a substitute: - For 1 cup of all-purpose flour, replace 2 tablespoons with cornstarch (for this recipe, \u00bd cup all-purpose flour minus 1 tablespoon cornstarch). 2. Increase Moisture Add more liquid : If the batter feels too thick, add an additional 1-2 tablespoons of milk or buttermilk . Buttermilk helps tenderize the cake and keeps it moist. Oil : Replace half or all of the butter with oil. Oil generally makes cakes softer and moister than butter. 3. Use Yogurt or Sour Cream Adding 1-2 tablespoons of yogurt or sour cream to your batter can provide extra moisture and softness. The acidity of yogurt/sour cream tenderizes the gluten in the flour. 4. Add a Little More Baking Powder Adding a tiny bit more baking powder (not too much) can help make the cake rise more and be fluffier. For your 4-inch cake, you can increase the baking powder by \u215b teaspoon . 5. Don\u2019t Overmix the Batter Be gentle with mixing. Overmixing causes gluten to develop, leading to a dense cake. After adding the dry ingredients to the wet, mix just until combined. Overmixing will result in a stiffer cake. 6. Bake at a Lower Temperature Try baking the cake at a slightly lower temperature, 140-150\u00b0C (285-300\u00b0F) , for a longer period of time. This allows the cake to rise more slowly, resulting in a fluffier texture. Keep an eye on it, as it will take a little longer to bake but will turn out softer. 7. Add a Simple Syrup After baking, brush the cake with a simple syrup (equal parts water and sugar, boiled and cooled). This adds extra moisture and keeps the cake soft for a longer time. 8. Use Vinegar or Lemon Juice You can add \u00bd teaspoon of vinegar or lemon juice to your batter along with the milk or buttermilk. The acidity helps break down gluten, making the cake softer. 9. Avoid Overbaking Be careful not to overbake the cake, as this can dry it out and make it stiffer. Test for doneness with a toothpick after the minimum bake time. 10. Use Cornstarch in the Flour As mentioned before, cornstarch lightens the flour. Use 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with your all-purpose flour to mimic cake flour. This results in a finer, softer texture. Example Recipe Adjustments for 4-inch Eggless Cake: Flour : \u00bd cup (60 grams) all-purpose flour, substitute 1 tablespoon with cornstarch Baking powder : \u215c teaspoon (\u00bc + \u215b teaspoon) Oil : Use 2 tablespoons of oil instead of butter, or mix 1 tablespoon butter with 1 tablespoon oil Milk or buttermilk : \u00bc cup + 1 tablespoon (add an extra tablespoon for more moisture) Yogurt : 1 tablespoon Vanilla extract : \u00bd teaspoon Optional Simple Syrup : After baking, brush on 1 tablespoon of syrup (1:1 water and sugar ratio).
