            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I have 11 years of experience in the IT industry, including 8+ years as a Databricks certified data engineer and data analyst, specializing in designing and maintaining ETL pipelines to support Retail Healthcare analytics. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My experience includes batch data processing, integration, performance optimization, migration, and production support for Big Data projects using Airflow, PySpark, Databricks, and Azure.
            </p>
            <p>
                I can utilize Python and SQL to leverage PySpark, and I have foundational knowledge in REST API methodologies with web application experience using Flask, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, along with Data Engineering technologies like Azure, Databricks, Airflow, Hadoop, and Git.
            </p>
            <p>
                I developed an in-house monitoring tool for tracking 1200+ Airflow tasks 24/7, saving 20+ hours monthly, enhancing team productivity, and addressing the challenge of alerting for long-running tasks. I also created a time-saving Rally-GitLab integration, eliminating manual updates and saving 4+ hours monthly for multiple teams.
            </p>
            <p>
                I thrive while understanding corporate structures with a functional programming mindset, optimizing processes in global organizations, and have experience managing contractor teams.
